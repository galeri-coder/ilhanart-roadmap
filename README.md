# İlhanArt  
## Cultural Infrastructure, Art, Science, and Long-Term Civilization Orientation

İlhanArt is not a gallery, a token project, or a short-term cultural initiative.  
İlhanArt is a long-horizon cultural structure designed to explore, preserve, and transmit meaning across generations, technologies, and future forms of life.

This repository is a **time-stamped cultural archive**, not marketing material.

---

## TL;DR

- **What it is:** A civilization-scale cultural infrastructure project focused on meaning preservation.  
- **Trust layer:** **[PoArt] (Proof of Art)**, a human-authorship verification protocol using evidence packs + public registry.  
- **What’s here:** Roadmap orientation, protocol rules, and reference implementation notes.

---

## What İlhanArt Is

İlhanArt operates at the intersection of:

- Contemporary art  
- Cultural memory  
- Scientific inquiry  
- Ethical infrastructure  
- Collective imagination  

İlhanArt does not aim to dominate cultural space.  
It aims to **stabilize** it.

---

## What İlhanArt Is Not

- İlhanArt is **not** an investment promise.  
- İlhanArt is **not** a speculative art or NFT project.  
- İlhanArt is **not** dependent on a single individual, artist, or era.  
- İlhanArt is **not** built for rapid growth or hype cycles.

---

## Core Principle

> Meaning must survive speed.

Technological, economic, and cultural systems accelerate faster than biological and ethical evolution.  
İlhanArt exists to slow, regulate, and contextualize that acceleration through culture.

---

## Mission

To design and sustain cultural structures that:

- Protect artistic and scientific production from market volatility  
- Preserve **context**, not just content  
- Enable participation rather than passive consumption  
- Regulate the **direction** of progress rather than its volume  
- Remain functional beyond founders, platforms, and technologies  

---

## Vision

A civilization-scale cultural infrastructure where:

- Art, science, and education are not separate domains  
- Cultural memory is resistant to collapse, censorship, and erasure  
- Ethical reflection evolves alongside technological capability  
- Meaning is transferable across centuries and planetary boundaries

- A preserved context  
- A silent cultural trace accompanying humanity beyond its star

# [PoArt] (Proof of Art) Protocol  
## The Trust Layer of the İlhanArt Ecosystem

**[PoArt]** is the verification layer that ensures each roadmap phase is not only a digital narrative, but a **verifiable production system in physical reality**.

[PoArt] focuses on three things:
- **Human identity continuity**
- **Labor + process evidence**
- **Publicly checkable transparency**

---

## The 5 Standards (Action → Outcome)

### 1) Live Identity Proof (Anti “Ghost Devs”)  
**Action:** The artist/developer stays visibly present through sustainable live production and archival continuity.  
**Outcome:** The “ghost developer” model collapses. Authorship remains physically anchored.

### 2) Labor & Process Proof (Human vs. Synthetic)  
**Action:** Evidence favors production over generation: real time, real friction, real hours.  
**Outcome:** “Fast output” is separated from “slow creation” through verifiable process trails.

### 3) Aesthetic Value Proof (Anti Low-Effort)  
**Action:** Artistic discipline becomes part of the trust collateral, not just a chart narrative.  
**Outcome:** The ecosystem rewards craft, not minimal effort.

### 4) Conceptual Novelty (Imagine the Unmade Bridge)  
**Action:** Require a thesis, not repetition. The concept must introduce something genuinely unmade.  
**Outcome:** Originality becomes auditable: a new cultural proposition, not recycled patterns.

### 5) Non-Algorithmic Agency (Prove Will, Not Automation)  
**Action:** A human must take risks, sweat, and stay present. Automation cannot replace intent.  
**Outcome:** The protocol validates a person and a vision, not an algorithmic facade.

## [PoArt] Verified (Plain English)

**[PoArt] Verified** means:

- The creator identity is consistent and traceable  
- The work has a real production trail (not only a final image)  
- Key metadata is stable and public (date, series, medium, size, edition)  
- If minted, token references match the public registry  
- The verification can be re-checked later using the same rules  

**Only “[PoArt] Verified” is official.**  
Ambiguous labels like “approved” or “certified” are not recognized.

---

## The 365-Day Rule (Renewal)

Verification must stay alive.

- Default renewal period: **365 days**  
- If a reliable annual archive exists, renewal may be reduced to **1 month** for faster integrity checks  

If evidence links break or renewal lapses, the status can be **suspended** until restored.

---

## Public Verification Checklist

Use this checklist for transparent audits:

- [ ] Does the work have a **Verification ID**?  
- [ ] Are **Evidence Pack** links accessible (streams, archives, logs)?  
- [ ] Is the **renewal date** valid under the 365-Day Rule?  
- [ ] Does the registry entry match token references (if minted)?  
- [ ] Has the objection window cleared (if applicable)?  

---

## Governance & Anti-Fraud System

[PoArt] supports dispute handling and anti-fraud safeguards:

### Strategic Filter  
A lightweight pre-check blocks spam disputes and low-effort attacks.

### Community Veto (40%)  
If **40% of the community** objects *with evidence*, verification cannot be granted or can be escalated.

### Solana-Gated Anti-Bot / Anti-Sybil  
Participation may be gated with on-chain checks to reduce bots and Sybil farms (implementation-dependent).

### Evidence Pack Freezing  
When a dispute begins, the Evidence Pack may be snapshotted and frozen:
- Snapshot links and media references  
- Timestamp the snapshot  
- Prevent silent edits during review  

### Transparency & Time-Lock  
Changes should be publicly visible, logged, and (when feasible) delayed through a time-lock window.

## Transparency Box (Addresses)

Publish these references wherever [PoArt] is used:

- Mint address  
- Treasury address  
- Lock / vesting address  
- Registry source (JSON URL or commit hash)  

**UI rule:** Unknown fields should show **“—”** and placeholders like “(to be added)” or “YYYY-MM-DD” should be auto-hidden.

---

## Registry (JSON)

The registry is a public JSON list of entries. Recommended fields:

- `artist`  
- `work_title`  
- `series`  
- `date` (YYYY-MM-DD or “—”)  
- `medium`  
- `dimensions`  
- `verification_status` (`verified` | `pending` | `revoked`)  
- `chain` (`Solana` | `Ethereum` | `—`)  
- `token_id` (click-to-copy in UI)  
- `contract_or_mint`  
- `evidence_pack`  
- `last_renewal` (YYYY-MM-DD or “—”)  

**UI note:** Render the registry from JSON and keep an **ILHAN** row pinned at the bottom.

---

## Repository Layout (suggested)

- `docs/` Protocol docs (PROTOCOL.md, VERIFICATION.md, GOVERNANCE.md)  
- `registry/` Registry schema + example JSON  
- `site-snippets/` Single-block safe embeds for web  
- `assets/` Logos, icons, banners  

---

## Contributing

---

## Security & Reporting

If you find flaws in verification flow, registry integrity, or evidence handling:
- Prefer private reporting when possible, or  
- Open an issue without exposing sensitive details.

---

## License

Pick one:
- **MIT** (code)  
- **CC BY 4.0** (documentation)  
- Dual-license (MIT for code, CC BY for docs)

---

## Disclaimer

[PoArt] is a verification and documentation protocol.  
It is not financial advice, not an investment guarantee, and not a promise of future value.  
Verification indicates **evidence consistency**, not market outcomes.

## Final Statement

Stars may change.  
Cultures can move.  
Meaning must not be lost.

This repository exists as a cultural timestamp.
